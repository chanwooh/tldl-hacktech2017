## Inspiration
It is proven we learn best when we're able to focus 100% during meetings, lectures, etc. However, we're often compelled to divert our attention to note-taking for future reference. This actually inhibits our ability to absorb as much material and information as possible when it is presented to us.

## What it does
Thus, TL;DL was born. It listens and takes notes for you! Whether it be a long GE lecture, that manager with an incredibly monotonous voice, or a speech you want notes for, Too Long; Didn't Listen will take smart notes for you.

## How we built it
Front End: We used Html/CSS and JavaScript to create the UI.
Back End: We used PHP and Google's Cloud to convert the speech to text.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to make smart notes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Clean UI, working application

## What we learned
Hacking is fun :)

## What's next for Too Long; Didn't Listen
Adding translations, importing existing audio, polishing UI, and exporting notes.
